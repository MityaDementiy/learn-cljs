# Section 0: Why ClojureScript Matters

In this section, we take our first look at ClojureScript with the goal of understanding its relationship to JavaScript as well as the Clojure language. We will discover ClojureScript's utility as a tool for modern web development. Like any tool, ClojureScript is not well suited for every task, so we will identify the areas where it may not be the best choice. Finally, we will end with a brief survey of the syntax and data types in ClojureScript and walk through its execution model.
